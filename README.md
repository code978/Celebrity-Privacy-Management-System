# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` with `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list

## Celebrity Privacy Management System

The Celebrity Privacy Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to empower famous personalities and their teams to manage their public presence with ease and confidentiality. Here's a breakdown of its features:

1. **User Interface**: The system boasts an intuitive user interface crafted with React and styled for aesthetic appeal using CSS. Vite ensures fast development and hot module replacement (HMR) for seamless updates.

2. **Search Functionality**: Users can quickly locate celebrities using the search bar, which filters the list based on the entered name.

3. **Accordion View**: Celebrities are listed in an accordion-style layout, allowing users to expand and collapse individual entries. Clicking on a celebrity's name enlarges their details while collapsing others, providing a clutter-free viewing experience.

4. **Data Management**: Celebrity details, including name, age (calculated from date of birth), gender, country, and description, are fetched from a JSON file and displayed dynamically. The gender field offers multiple options, including Male, Female, Transgender, Rather not say, and Other.

5. **Edit and Delete**: Users can edit a celebrity's details directly within the system. Upon editing, changes are saved with the click of a button, or users can revert to the original data using the cancel option. Additionally, the system supports secure deletion of celebrity entries, with a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental deletions.

6. **TypeScript Integration**: Developed using TypeScript, the system ensures type safety and better code organization, enhancing overall development productivity and maintainability.

In summary, the Celebrity Privacy Management System combines cutting-edge technologies to provide celebrities and their teams with a powerful tool to manage their public presence effectively while maintaining confidentiality and control.
